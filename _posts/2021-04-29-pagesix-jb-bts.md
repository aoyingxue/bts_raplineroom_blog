消息来源说，“他们正在花时间进行制作，保证合作曲以一个正确的形式发布出来。”

“They are taking their time on it and going to make sure it is released right,” says the source.

知情者猜测，这首歌可能会是JB最近发行的专辑Justice豪华版再贩中的一首，以保证专辑继续保持在榜单上（也是继Triple Chunks Deluxe后的第二版再贩）。

Our insider speculates that the track “could be part of a deluxe release of [[Bieber’s recently released album\] ‘Justice’](https://nypost.com/2021/03/19/with-new-justice-justin-biebers-comeback-fis-complete/) to keep the album on the charts.” (It would be the record’s second re-release, following the “Triple Chucks Deluxe” edition.)

这次合作看起来是两者的唱片公司合并的结果。

The collaboration seems to be the result of a merger between the artists’ respective record companies.
