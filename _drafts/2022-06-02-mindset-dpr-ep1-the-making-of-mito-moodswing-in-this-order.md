我为生命中不同时期选择不同的名字，只是源于我对创造新的行为、新的角色、新的身份的热爱。我就是一个这样的人。

第一集：Moodswings in This Order，MITO的制作过程。

我是DPR IAN，一名艺术家，也同时是DPR的视觉总监。

你知道吗，我们每个人的人生都会经历不同的阶段，而在这些不同的阶段里，你会进化成与过去不同的某个特定角色。我想我所做的只是，为我在这段旅程或人生阶段的角色取一个名字，你知道的，我从小就开始这么做了。

我出生在悉尼，但快到小学毕业的时候我搬到了卧龙岗。悉尼对亚洲人更友好，这里更像是一个社区。但是当我去卧龙岗的时候，我还记得我走进学校的第一天，因为我上的是表演艺术学校，你知道，大家要么是白人，要么是中东人，我想没有亚洲人，你知道吗？说实话，我没怎么认真想过这些。我觉得我当时很幸运，没有因为他们对我的看法而产生负面影响。我记得有很多人来找我，因为他们把李小龙和成龙作为亚洲人的参考对象。

可能是因为他们看的电影吧，他们觉得我会和李小龙和成龙有直接的关系，不过我觉得也挺有道理的？毕竟我也有那样的发型，所以……

他们是真的相信我是李小龙的亲戚，大多数时候，我都很配合。我真的真的很配合演出，然而我想最令人沮丧的地方在于我甚至不喜欢武术，但正因为如此我不得不学习它。我得学武术，为了第二天去学校给他们表演。

所以，我真的做到了。我回到家，妈妈偶尔下楼到一楼的时候，会看到我在转棍子。她会问，“你在干什么？”我说，“妈妈，你会明白的。”那时候它对我来说是必要的东西。令人惊讶的是我变得非常擅长，我非常能使棍用剑。不管算是被强迫还是自愿，反正我变得真的很擅长。我回到学校，展示给我的朋友们看，我觉得他们看到的时候是有被震撼到的。

说实话，这是赢得大家喜爱的第一步。

我记得小时候去看音乐剧，第一个看的是《猫》，那时候大概七岁吧。我现在还记得它给我的感觉，一个七岁的孩子看着这些人打扮成猫的样子像猫一样表演，真的太震撼了。你可以看到他们充满戏剧性的表演，其中的音乐更加夸大了这一点。它给了我一种无法解释的感觉，但我觉得在那个年纪我……我只知道我想做点能为他人输出的事情。换句话说，我想通过艺术、通过表达来为他人的生活带来影响。

那时候有个很宏大的时代背景、文化背景，人们都喜欢像硬核金属、硬核摇滚这样的金属乐，那也成为了我的生活，我完全陷入恋爱。我只是一个单纯的喜欢硬核的小孩，听很多愤怒的音乐，但我并不愤怒。这更像是缓解压力的办法，但我想那是我踏入音乐世界的第一步。如果你去看这些硬核演出的话，你会经常看到人群冲浪的景象，人们在舞台跳上跳下，而且问题是，也没有保安什么的。要真说，主唱还有乐队，他们很接受这样的东西。这成为了一种文化体系，所以看到二三十个人这样做之后，我就在想，“为什么不这么干呢？毕竟人只能活一次。”所以我也跳上了舞台，我记得我和主唱交换了眼神，就跳上去了。

一开始觉得挺吓人的，因为你担心别人可能会接不住你，但其实很稳，人们可能会被击倒或者摔倒，但一旦有人倒下，大家都很有礼貌地停下并把对方扶起来。我觉得这也是真正吸引我融入这种文化的原因，每个人虽然看起来在互殴，在愤怒，但其实是互相在意对方的。说实话那是我一生中拥有的最棒的经历之一。

说实话，如果我留在澳大利亚，我真的觉得我可能会加入一个硬核金属乐队，可能会真正地深入那个世界。

我妈妈想让我成为一名牙医，但是，我觉得我的手不适合成为一名牙医，感觉我会一不小心就拿掉别人一颗牙之类的。而且我已经大概知道我想要做什么了，不是去上大学也不是获得某种文凭或学位。我一直想去韩国旅行，想做一些真正伟大的事情，但我只是不知道那件事究竟是什么。那时的我单纯是一个充满激情和野心的孩子，但这足以让我思考：“是啊，我不需要再上学了。”我还记得下飞机的时候我在想，‘哇，感觉每个人都是韩国人。’当时我不会说韩语。你知道的，我不太擅长韩语，所以我过得很艰难，因为所有人都认为我懂韩语，单纯因为我长得像韩国人。

还记得我在韩国的最开始几个月，我凌晨3点就出门，因为我真的很饿，然后我遇到了这位西装革履、系着红色领带的人。我也不知道他为什么系着一条红色领带，但它很明显，我就记住了这个特点。他找到我问我多大了，我是做什么的。我本以为这是一个商业骗局什么的，他递给我一张名片，问我能不能去，就在第二天，他让我到一个地方。名片上写着Yedang（也就是yu导前东家）。

第二天我去了那个地址，当我到那的时候，排了大概30人的长队。有些人在唱歌，有些人在跳舞，还有的在练习什么。原来那是一次试镜。

而我穿着凉鞋和短裤来的，很显然我并没有为此做好心理和身体上的准备。于是我转身准备离开的，但就在我转身的时候，前一天找我的那个人朝我走来说，“哦，你来得正是时候。”我告诉他我毫无准备，不过那时候，我是个b-boy，所以那些人跟之前找我的那个人说，“要不我们借用一下前一个人的音乐吧，你就用它freestyle一下。”我说：“好吧，freestyle我还是可以的，我做过几回。”于是他们打开了这首歌。

那时候我不知道那首歌是什么，其实那是Psy的Champion，一首挺滑稽的歌，但我完全不知道，我就很认真地跟着这首歌跳了b-boy，freestyle着在地上旋转。我脑里想，‘我完蛋了，完全不知道现在在发生什么，感觉大家都在笑。”然后我低着头出去了。就在我往回走的时候，我收到了一条短信，问我第二天能不能再来。第二天我就直接成为了一名练习生，一切就是这样开始了。很窒息，他们把整个培训过程变成了一个生存项目。每个星期我们都要想自己的表演歌曲，不管它是翻唱还是其他什么，反正我们必须周末的时候在所有人面前表演，CEO，室长啊，经理啊之类的。然后他们会对你进行评判，就像淘汰赛一样，所以从一开始竞争就非常激烈。

他们想让我当队长，但作为一个K-pop组合的队长，是要承担很多责任的，你不仅要负责这个组合，而且你还得是那个最能发言的人。无论是在电视节目、脱口秀还是其他什么节目上，你的韩语必须切中要点，这大概是我不得不学习韩语的终极方式。我当时和另外五个韩国男生一起，他们来自韩国的不同地区，而在韩国的每个地方每个地区，有不同的韩语方言。他们几个人都有各自的方言，所以我的韩语是跟其他几个有完全不同方言的人学的。最重要的是，我还有澳大利亚口音，结果后来，我的韩语就变成一股朝鲜语的味道，所以……人们听着很困惑。

从你成为练习生的那一天起，你和他们就得像家人一样，没有其他的选择。

这感觉真的很强烈，就像我被突然抛进了这个世界，和这些人一起分享一切，床啊，厕所啊，衣服啊，只要你能想到的。天，这真的真的很难。你把所有人都安排在一个屋檐下，还有两个经纪人，相当于八个人住在同一个房子，同一个宿舍里。天，这太糟糕了。

我们甚至被要求不允许看任何其他组合或偶像，不能直视他们的眼睛……我们不允许有眼神接触或任何接触，因为说到底，他们是我们的竞争对手。所以，他们给我们洗脑，以至于我们不得不把每个人都视为敌人。我们不允许在车里睡觉，不允许在休息室里坐下，因为我们必须得时刻保持紧张。如果我们做了这些事情，就得跪在走廊上，其他人从我们身边经过，那是我一生中最尴尬的感受之一。为了避免那种感觉，我就会乖乖听他们的。有一段时间我们的…有些成员被打了，我回到家看见他们躺在地板上。我们也不能跟父母说，我清楚地记得管理部门员工把我拉到一边对我说：“你可以告诉父母你想要什么，但你要知道这不是一个明智的选择。”有过很多类似的时刻，你不得不完全克制自己，完全掩盖自己的感受。我知道我必须做点别的事，得有个应急计划，否则我逃不掉这一切。

I choose a different name for every different period of my life. It really just stemmed from my love for, uh, creating new demeanors, characters, identities. I'm all about that.

Episode one: The making of MITO, Moodswings in This Order.

I'm DPR IAN. I'm an artist as well as a visual director in DPR.

We all go through different stages at our lives, you know? In these different stages, you evolve into a certain character that you were not before. All I'm doing is just, I guess I'm placing a name for that character for this series of my journey or this stage of my life. And I think I've always done that, you know, ever since I was little.

So I was born in Sydney, but I moved to Wollongong when I almost finished elementary school. In Sydney, it's a little bit more Asian friendly, if you know what I mean. There's a bit of, more of a community there. But when I went to Wollongong, I remember the first day I walked into the school. Cause I went to a performing arts school. Everyone was, you know, either Caucasian or, you know, Middle Eastern, and there was just no like, I guess, Asians, you know? Honestly, I didn't really think much of it. I think I was fortunate enough to not really receive a negative impact through how, like, how they saw me as, you know. It was rather, um, I remember, like a lot of the guys came up to me and like their cross-reference for an Asian was, uh, Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. 

It's kind of more from, uh, the movies they see. And they thought I was directly related to Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, which I mean, fair enough, you know? I mean, I kind of had the hair going, so... 

They really, really believed I was Bruce Lee's cousin. And for the most part, I played along. I really, I played along and I guess the down part for that was I wasn't even into martial arts, but because of that I had to pick it up. I had to learn martial arts. So the next day I went to school, I had to show them. 

So, so I really did that. I went back home and occasionally my mom would come down to the first floor and she would see me twirling a stick. And she's like, "What are you doing?" And I was like, "Mom, you'll understand." It's a necessity at this point. So surprisingly, I'm very good, I'm very good of sticks, I'm very good with swords. Call it forced or not. I mean, I'm still pretty good at it. And I went back to school and I showed my mates and, you know, I think when they saw that, I guess they were blown away.

And honestly, that was the first step of winning everyone over. 

I remember when I was younger, I went to watch like musical, I think Cats was the very first thing I saw, I think I was about seven years old. And I remember the feeling it gave me. It was so overwhelming, you know, seven year old kid watching like these people dress up as cats acting like cats and you have their performances. It's theatrical and the music overplaying that. It gave me a rush of feelings that I could not explain. But I think at that age, I've... all I knew I wanted to do was I wanted to make something that gave that to somebody. In other words, I wanted to impact someone's life through art, through expression.

At that time, there was a huge scene, a huge culture for metal, like hardcore metal, hardcore rock, and that became my life. That just totally sucked me in. I was just this hardcore kid that listened to a lot of angry music. I wasn't angry. It was actually stress relieving at the time. But I mean, I guess that was my first step into the whole music world. If you go to one of these hardcore shows, you see a lot of crowd surfing. It's like a thing, you know, people jump on stage and they just jump off. And the thing is, there's no security or anything. If anything, the, uh, lead vocalist, the band, they actually embrace it. It's like a whole culture thing. So after seeing about 20 or 30 people doing that, I was like, "You know what, why not? You know, you only live once." So I just, I jumped on stage. I remember making eye contact with the lead singer, and then I just jumped.

Initially, it's actually quite frightening because, um, you don't think people would catch you, but it's actually very supportive. People do get knocked out and people do fall down. But once someone gets knocked out or once they fall down, everyone's very respectful. They stop and they pick each other up. I think that's what really, really also drew me into this whole culture because everyone at the end of the day, it looks like everyone's punching each other and everyone's mad and stuff, but they actually care. That was honestly one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life.

Honestly, if I stayed in Australia, I honestly think I would have ended up in one of those hardcore metal bands, and I think I would have went really deep into that whole world.

My mom wanted me to become a dentist, but, um, I feel like my hands are just not right to be a dentist. I feel I would accidentally take people's teeth cells and stuff. I kind of knew already what I wanted to do with my life, and it wasn't going to uni or, or getting some type of diploma or degree. I've always wanted to travel out to Korea and I wanted to start something really big, but I had no idea what that really big thing was. It was just a young kid with a lot of passion, a lot of ambition. That was literally enough for me to be like, "Yeah, I don't need to study anymore." I remember getting off the plane and I remember just thinking, 'Wow, like, everyone is Korean.' I didn't know how to speak Korean at the time. You know, I wasn't very good at it, so I had a very hard time because everyone assumed that I knew Korean because obviously I look Korean. 

First few months that I was in Korea, I remember going out at 3 a.m. cause I was really hungry. So I was confronted by this, this gentleman in a suit with a red tie. I don't know why he was wearing a red tie, but it was very specific. That's what I remember. And he approached me and he asked me, like, how old I was, what I did for a living. I thought it was like a, a business scam or something like that. He handed me this name card and he asked me if I can make it. It was actually the next day. He asked me to come to a certain location. On the card it read Yedang. 

I went the next day to the, uh, address. When I got there, it was like a huge line of 30 people. Like some were singing, some were, like dancing or, you know, they were practicing something. It was an audition.

I rocked up in my sandals and shorts. Obviously, I wasn't prepared for this, physically or mentally. And so I turned around. But as I was turning, the guy that approached me the day before was walking towards me and he was like, "Oh, you're right here on time." I told him I had nothing prepared. At that time, I was b-boying, so they got the person that went before me and they, and they were like, "Let's borrow that person's music. And what you can do is freestyle over that." And I was like, "Alright, okay. I mean, I can freestyle, you know, I've done that a few times.'" So they, um, turned the song on.

And at that time, I didn't know what the song was, but it was a song called Psy Champion. It's a pretty comical song, but I had no idea, so I was very seriously b-boying to this song. I was freestyling, seriously, I was on the ground, I was like spinning. And in my head, I was like, 'Yeah, I'm screwed. I have no idea, like, what's happening right now. Know idea why everyone's laughing.' I went out with my head down. As I was walking back, I got a text message asking if I could come back in the next day. Straightaway, the next day I was a trainee, and that's how, that's how everything really, really started off. It was very overwhelming. When we're doing the whole trainee process, they would try to make it like a survival program. Every week we would have to come up with our own performance song, whether it'd be a cover or anything, and we would have to perform it at the end of the week in front of everyone, you know, the CEO, the 실장, the managers, whatnot. And from then, they would judge you and it would be like an elimination round at the end of the thing. So it was very high, intense from the get go. 

They wanted me to become the leader of the group. Being a leader of a, of a K-pop group, it, it comes with so much responsibility because not only are you taking charge of the group, but you also have to be the one that speaks out the most. You know, whether that be at shows, talk shows, whatnot, so your Korean has to be on point. I think that was the ultimate way in which I had to learn Korean. You know, I was with five
other Korean guys. They were from different regions of Korea. Each part of Korea, different regions, they have a dialect to how they speak Korean. They all have these different dialects. So I'm picking up my Korean from about three other guys that have completely different dialects. And on top of that, I have an Australian accent. So later, my Korean would turn out like how North Korean people would speak. So, so this... people would be so confused.

From the day you're a trainee, it's like you become like a family with them, without choice.

It was intense, like I was just dropped into this world of, of just all these guys, you know, sharing everything. Beds, toilets, clothes, you know, you name it. Oh man, it was, it was hard. You put everyone under one roof with like two managers, you're about eight guys in one house, one dorm. Man, that was the worst.

We were told we weren't even allowed to look at any of the other groups or idols. We weren't allowed to look at them in the eyes, um.. We weren't allowed to make eye contact or any contact because at the end of the day, they are competition. So we were, they were kind of brainwashing us to the point where we had to view everyone as our enemies. We're not allowed to sleep in the car. We're not allowed to sit down in our green room cause we have to keep our tension up. If we do any of those things, we had to kneel down in the corridor where everyone was passing us by. It was one of the most embarrassing feelings I've ever, ever had in my life. And because I wanted to avoid feeling like that, I would just listen to them. There was a point where even our... some of the members were, were getting hit. I would come home to see them like lying on the floor and stuff. We weren't allowed to say any of this to our parents. I remember specifically one of the guys from management pulled me aside and was like, "You can tell your parents all you want, but, you know, it wouldn't be a smart choice.'" I remember there was so many of those type of moments where you would have to hold yourself back completely, completely shade away how you feel. And, yeah, just put up a front. I knew I had to do something else with my life. I knew I had to have a backup plan, otherwise, I was not getting out of this. 



If there's one thing that came out of this whole idol business is I got close to a lot of the people that I worked with in production. I remember when I first started videography, there was no reference. In Korea, if you wanted to be a director at the time, you'd have to do five years being a runner, ten years of being an assistant director. And only then after that you can be a director, hence, which is why the age gap, like all the older videographers in Korea, all these directors that were doing it for 20, 30 years, they're about 40. You don't get your first full project until the age of 35, 36. And that was such the norm back then in Korea, and it was crazy for me cause I was like, ' You can just pick up a camera and literally shoot and you could be a director.' But the whole hierarchy thing also really does, um, I think, play a huge role for this, you know, cause the whole Asian culture, it really kind of, I guess, dwells on that. I had yet to see someone that was young and was, you know, striving and doing their own production and managing their own thing. The whole idea of the whole entrepreneurship was, was very faint. I was looking for kids my age that wanted to do videography cause I kind of wanted to make this whole true, but I couldn't find any. And when I first
introduced myself as a director, I remember a lot of the productions, they really looked down on me until I landed my first project, which was for Bobby. And I think I was about 25. I was working with big money at the time cause before that I was working with a budget of like 10, 15K at most. You know, it wasn't, it was just small money. But then when landing this big project, you know, it's, it's going up into 100, 200 thousands. So now, all of a sudden, I need a team, I need the DOP, I need the gaffers, I need the runners, I need all this team, which I don't have. Sol, I remember I went to this director that shot for my music video for when I was in my idol group. And I asked that person, like, "Where can I find these connects? I do not want to fail this, and a lot of people are looking down on me, and a lot of people don't trust me in doing this." So that person was like, "I'll help you. But for each contact that I give you, you have to edit one video for me." So that's what I did. I edited about six or seven videos, I think. Every video I edited, I got one contact in return. The shitty part about that was some of the contacts that I got, didn't want to do it with me. So... So I was like maybe you should confirm that first, you know? So eventually I got together a group who at the time were still older than me, but they were like the first camera assistant, the first gaffer, first art assistant. It was their first time also handling a big project such as this. And I remember just for two months, I just went completely in.

I wanted to be very unorthodox with this. I wanted to put an idol in a spotlight where people weren't used to seeing an idol, you know? A little bit more wild, a little bit more outrageous, dirty. You know, not, none of that whole saturated clean aesthetic look. I kind of wanted to break away from that and wanted to give a certain grime to Bobby as an artist.

That was very experimental and a lot of the production companies at that time never went that route because it was kind of more like, let's play it safe. Let's just give them a product. Let's just make him look good and everything. And that's kind of the mindset for a lot of, uh, the directors out there in Korea, but I kind of challenged that. 

At that time, Bobby and Mino they were having all these other songs that were coming out that had videos. So it's kind of like a competition, at the end of the day, and a lot of these productions thought they would be getting the solo for Bobby's music video, but they didn't. So they started really throwing shade on us. And even on set, I remember walking on and there's about 50 staff members, they're old and they knew... they were asking who the director was. And when they saw it was like this 25 year old kid, they weren't taking it seriously.

I think it was after the first shot, the first scene, I manifested this scene so much that I knew it had to work. It was in this dark room, and just as the beat's about to drop into the hook, the lights come on and the camera just pans out completely. And all of a sudden you have this ray of lights and power, and it's just a crazy, crazy, beautiful, chaotic mess where it can't help but make people feel something. And I remember the first take of that shot, when I told the camera to roll and I called action, I remember everyone just started being in complete awe. 

I think that was my first relief of winning this, this crowd over on production. 

The whole idea of DPR is to get back at people that have only this as a reference of idols or, you know, having, having to be on certain music programs or whatnot and have to be on stations. I think DPR is a whole new model, a whole new reference for showing people that you can be real as well. You can be as genuine as you want to be and you can still make it.

The fact that I think that I can finally somewhat replicate what that experience has given to me, back then when I was seven years old, through this group, through these guys, that's everything. My whole life, I guess, built me up to the point where I found these guys, where it allowed me to be in an environment where I could just purely focus on something like that. And I think that's something special.

I just want you to close all the doors.

Just leave me alone.

I try to hide it.

I'm scared of what's next.

I still don't know where to go.

So welcome to the show.
