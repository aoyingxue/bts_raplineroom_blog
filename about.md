## About BTS

**BTS** ([Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language): 방탄소년단; [RR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean): **Bangtan Sonyeondan**), also known as the **Bangtan Boys**, is a seven-member South Korean [boy band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band) that began its formation in [Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul) in 2010.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS_(band)#cite_note-3) The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a [hip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music) group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an [alternative universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universes_in_fiction) storyline. The group have staged several world tours.

Following the establishment of their [Love Myself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Myself_(campaign)) anti-violence campaign in partnership with [UNICEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF), BTS addressed the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) 73rd [General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly) and became the youngest ever recipients of the [Order of Cultural Merit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Cultural_Merit_(Korea)) from the [President of South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Korea) due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language.
