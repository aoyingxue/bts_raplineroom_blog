## About the website

At first, I translated news on Weibo. After a while, I need an archive for all the translations. So thanks to Github Pages, I built the website on the shoulder of other amazing developers. 

Most of the news will be credited to the original website or YouTube video, unless it's lost. Credits to all those contributed. Domain is distributed by Google Domain and hosted by GitHub Repo. 

#### 2020/02/24 RaplineRoom Blog initiated. 

RaplineRoom is dedicated to all 7 members of BTS and especially 3 members of rapper line: RM, SUGA, and JHOPE. 

The website is mainly for recording all the translation of news and album reviews posted by North American media platforms, and it is also going to include the HD Editorial Phots that I bought from Getty, etc, in the future.
